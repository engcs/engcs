### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Junior Python Developer passionate about how things work and how to improve them. I have experience with projects using Python in desktop and now working to make them web. I have a degree in industrial electrical engineering with an emphasis on electronics and hardware development. I want to learn more about how to apply technology in real business and add more value.
